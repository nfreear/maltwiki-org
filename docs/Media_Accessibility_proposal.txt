A proposal for the development of software services and components to improve 
the accessibility of online video and multimedia (for learning)

N.D.Freear, The Open University, 10 January-11 February 2009.

Summary

Video and other multimedia are often key components of primary course materials, 
and can also be used informally as supplementary material on Open University 
courses [ref?]. Furthermore, the Open University and other educators have a 
quasi-marketing presence on various Web 2.0 sites, with for example introductory 
and "about learning with the OU" videos on YouTube 
[http://youtube.com/user/TheOpenUniversity] and iTunesU [http://podcast.open.ac.uk]. 
Certainly in the former case and probably in the latter (primary and 
supplementary/marketing material) the University has a legal obligation to 
provide alternative formats, like captions for the hard of hearing and 
audio description for visually impaired people. The Open University has some 
success in these areas (ref, 95% of OU iTunesU podcasts have transcripts, 
http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/itunesu/impact/ ), but coverage elsewhere is 
patchy. Services like YouTube allow the author to upload captions with their video, 
however the results are not fully accessible, and very few authors across the 
world use this feature. There are also significant barriers to the use of 
media players like the YouTube player in terms of control, particularly for 
speech recognition and screen reader users.

This project, provisionally termed Media Accessibility (MA), aims to provide a 
web site for the social and community co-creation, editing, storage and delivery 
of alternative formats, and software services and components to improve 
media players, where possible in-situ. In-situ may for example mean producing 
a Web browser plug-in that operates on the YouTube web site to deliver a player 
with improved controls and the display of alternative formats. It is proposed 
that the alternative formats (captions, audio description etc.) are created by 
a combination of automation and crowd-sourcing. Community participation would 
be encouraged by providing usable editing tools, strategic partnerships, 
individual recognition, feedback, and "social-karma" features. The proposed 
scope would initially be materials directly relevant to the Open University, 
partner organisations, and their students and staff. It would widen to 
educational multi-media generally, and eventually beyond education. Free and 
open access to alternative content and software tools is proposed as a 
key element of the project.
