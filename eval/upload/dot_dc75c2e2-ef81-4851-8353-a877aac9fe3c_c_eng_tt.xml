         <p begin='00:00:07.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">This is Blogs in Plain English.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:10.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">To make sense of blogs, you have to think about the news and who makes it.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:14.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">We'll look at news in the 20th Century vs. the 21st Century to make our point.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:18.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">In the 20th Century, the news produced professionally.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:21.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">When news happened, reporters wrote the stories,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:23.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">and a tiny group of people decided what appeared in a newspaper or broadcast.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:27.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">Professional news was mainstream - general and limited.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:31.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">The 21st century marked the point when news became both professional and personal.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:34.000' dur='00:00:05.000' style="4">A new kind of website called a weblog, or blog for short,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:39.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">came onto the scene that let anyone be a reporter and publisher.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:42.000' dur='00:00:01.000' style="4">often for free.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:43.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">As blogs became popular,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:45.000' dur='00:00:01.000' style="4">they created millions of news sources</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:46.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">that gave everyone an audience for their own version of news.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:50.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">Of course, we're using the word "news" loosely.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:52.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">But really, isn't everything news to someone?</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:55.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">With a blog, a business owner can share news about his business.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:00:59.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">A mother can share news about her family.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:02.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">Or a sports star can share news with fans.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:04.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">These people are all bloggers.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:07.000' dur='00:00:01.000' style="4">How did this happen?</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:08.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Well, blogs made sharing news on the web easy.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:11.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Anyone with an idea can start a new blog with a click of a button</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:14.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">and share news minutes later.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:16.000' dur='00:00:01.000' style="4">Here's how blogs work.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:17.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Blogs are websites that are organized by blog posts.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:20.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">These are individual news stories like articles in the paper.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:24.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Bloggers simply fill out a form like this one to post a new story.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:27.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">With the click of button, the blog post appears at the top of the web page,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:31.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">just above yesterday's news.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:33.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Over time, the blog becomes a collection of these posts.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:36.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">all archived for easy reference.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:38.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">Also, each blog post can become a discussion through comments left by readers.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:42.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Blogs make the news a two way street.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:45.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">But really, the fuss is not about how blogs work.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:48.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">It's what people like you do with them that matters.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:51.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Let's say you have a blog about green living and outdoor photography.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:54.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">It reflects your unique perspective.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:01:57.000' dur='00:00:05.000' style="4">This helps you build relationships with your readers and other bloggers with similar interests.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:02.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">Speaking of relationships, bloggers often work together.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:05.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">In addition to comments, you'll read each other's posts,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:08.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">quote each other and link your blogs together.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:11.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">This creates communities of bloggers that inspire and motivate each other.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:15.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">Whether it's their ease of use, or the opportunities they offer,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:19.000' dur='00:00:03.000' style="4">blogs have been adopted in a very big way.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:22.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">Since 2003, there have been over 70 million blogs created,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:26.000' dur='00:00:02.000' style="4">each with its own version of news.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:28.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">So the big deal about blogs is that they gave people like you the power of the media,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:32.000' dur='00:00:05.000' style="4">and it created a personal kind of news that appeals to a high number of small audiences.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:37.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">So, it's up to you. What will you do with this new power?</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:41.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">There is likely a group of people out there who want to hear what you have to say.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:45.000' dur='00:00:04.000' style="4">You can search for blogs using Google's Blogsearch or Technorati.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='00:02:49.000' dur='00:00:05.000' style="4">You can also start your own blog for free at Blogger or Wordpress.com</p>
