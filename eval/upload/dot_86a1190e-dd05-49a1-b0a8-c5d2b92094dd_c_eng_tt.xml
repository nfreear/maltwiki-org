         <p begin='0:00:07.000' end='0:00:10.000' style="4">and basically Roadtrip Nation started out over some frustration. </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:10.000' end='0:00:15.000' style="4">We graduated from university and we didn't know exactly what we wanted to do with our lives, </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:15.000' end='0:00:19.000' style="4">But we didn't identify with becoming lawyers, doctors or accountants and so we decided to take </p>

         <p begin='0:00:23.000' end='0:00:26.000' style="4">and simply ask them how did you get to where you are today?</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:26.000' end='0:00:33.000' style="4">And hopes of this entire journey was to get a better understanding of what we want to do with our own lives.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:33.000' end='0:00:37.000' style="4">Erm, to date we've been putting hundreds of other students on road trips.</p>
