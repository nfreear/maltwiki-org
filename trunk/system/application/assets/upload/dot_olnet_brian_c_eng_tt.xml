         <p begin='0:00:01.000' end='0:00:07.000' style="4">OK so ah my name's Brian McAllister and I'm a co-founder of a group called Roadtrip Nation</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:07.000' end='0:00:10.000' style="4">and basically Roadtrip Nation started out over some frustration. </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:10.000' end='0:00:15.000' style="4">We graduated from university and we didn't know exactly what we wanted to do with our lives, </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:15.000' end='0:00:18.000' style="4">But we didn't identify with becoming lawyers, doctors or accountants and so we decided </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:18.000' end='0:00:22.000' style="4">to take a road trip across the United States and talk to different people from all </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:22.000' end='0:00:26.000' style="4">walks of life to simply ask them how did you get to where you are today?</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:26.000' end='0:00:32.000' style="4">And hopes of this entire journey was to get a better understanding of what we want to do </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:32.000' end='0:00:37.000' style="4">with our own lives. To date we've been putting hundreds of other students on road trips.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:37.000' end='0:00:41.000' style="4">Erm, we've started more or less a movement across the United States</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:41.000' end='0:00:45.000' style="4">about students going out and talking to people and asking them some questions.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:45.000' end='0:00:51.000' style="4">And it's really about exposure. So Roadtrip Nation now has an inter, interview archive</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:51.000' end='0:00:55.000' style="4">of hundreds of interviews from different people, who have followed their passions in life.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:00:55.000' end='0:01:02.000' style="4">And simply its what we're here today at this conference is really to look at this space,</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:02.000' end='0:01:06.000' style="4"> an open space, of information exchange and sharing data </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:07.000' end='0:01:11.000' style="4">across different mechanisms and across borders. So, that whole generation that's perhaps </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:12.000' end='0:01:17.000' style="4">younger than us has a better sense of who they are and how to follow their own passions in life.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:18.000' end='0:01:25.000' style="4">Erm, and to be exposed to all these opportunities and what we feel passionate about is that exposure</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:26.000' end='0:01:31.000' style="4">really connects to relevancy and relevancy is all about this retention in school and academia.</p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:31.000' end='0:01:35.000' style="4">And you know, we have a better sense of who we are and what purpose there is </p>                              
        
         <p begin='0:01:35.000' end='0:01:40.000' style="4"> to the careers that we choose. So, that's a little bit about Roadtrip Nation.</p>
